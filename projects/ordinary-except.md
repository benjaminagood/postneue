description: >-
  We are interested in the ground plane. It determines the relationship between
  inside and outside, the tall and the low spaces, the public and the private,
  the ordinary and the exceptional. Our critique of the triple-decker typology
  lies in the elevated first floor that often feels excluding and may bar
  accessibility. In two gestures—lowering the first floor and economizing
  circulation—the triple-decker can accommodate the multiple and changing needs
  of the artist-residency and retain its flexibility should the program change.
  Structural strategies such as basement-post-and-beam and truss systems are
  used to provide adequate clearances among the three buildings, while
  sliding-facades and awning-doors allow permeation across the site and define
  the interstitial spaces as either passage or courtyard.
